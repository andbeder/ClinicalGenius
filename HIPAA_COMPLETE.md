## Quick Start - First Time Setup

### 1. Configure Environment

Edit `.env` file:
```env
# User Identity (Required for HIPAA)
SFDC_USERNAME=your-email@example.com

# HTTPS Configuration
USE_HTTPS=true

# Salesforce Configuration
SFDC_CLIENT_ID=your-salesforce-client-id
SFDC_LOGIN_URL=https://login.salesforce.com
KEY_PASS=your-key-passphrase

# LLM Configuration (Only approved providers)
LLM_PROVIDER=lm_studio  # or 'copilot' (BAA verified)
LM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:1234
COPILOT_API_KEY=your-copilot-key-if-using

# DO NOT use OpenAI (no BAA)
# OPENAI_API_KEY is disabled
```

### 2. Generate SSL Certificate (First Time Only)

```bash
python generate_ssl_cert.py
```

**Output:**
```
âœ… SSL Certificate generated successfully!
Certificate: ssl\localhost.crt
Private Key: ssl\localhost.key
Valid for: 10 years
```

### 3. Start Application

```bash
python app.py
```

**Output:**
```
ðŸ”’ SSL/TLS Enabled - Using self-signed certificate
Starting Clinical Genius on localhost:4000
Access URL: https://localhost:4000
Access restricted to: localhost only (127.0.0.1)
```

### 4. Access Application

1. Open browser to: **https://localhost:4000**
2. Accept security warning (self-signed certificate - this is expected)
3. Click "Advanced" â†’ "Proceed to localhost"
4. âœ… Application loads with HTTPS!

## Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify HIPAA compliance:

### Pre-Flight Checks

- [ ] `.env` file has `SFDC_USERNAME` configured
- [ ] SSL certificates exist in `ssl/` directory
- [ ] `.encryption_key` file exists (generated on first run)
- [ ] Database file `analysis_batches.db` is encrypted

### Runtime Verification

```bash
# Test HTTPS configuration
python test_https.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Clinical Genius - HTTPS Configuration Test
============================================================
âœ… PASS - HTTPS Connection
âœ… PASS - Security Headers
âœ… PASS - HTTP Redirect
âœ… PASS - SSL Certificate
============================================================
Results: 4/4 tests passed
ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! HTTPS is configured correctly.
```

### UI Verification

1. **User Identity:**
   - Open application
   - Check sidebar shows green badge with your email
   - If yellow/red: SFDC_USERNAME not configured

2. **Connection Security:**
   - Browser address bar shows lock icon (ðŸ”’)
   - Click lock icon â†’ "Connection is secure"

3. **Settings Tab:**
   - Navigate to Settings tab
   - Verify HIPAA Compliance section shows all controls

## What's Protected

### Data at Rest (Encrypted)
- âœ… Analysis batches and configurations
- âœ… Prompt templates and schemas
- âœ… Execution history and results
- âœ… Dataset configurations
- âœ… Audit logs database

**Encryption:** AES-256 via SQLCipher

### Data in Transit (Encrypted)
- âœ… Browser â†” Application: HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- âœ… Application â†” Salesforce: HTTPS (native)
- âœ… Application â†” Copilot: HTTPS (if used)
- âœ… Application â†” LM Studio: localhost only

**Encryption:** TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites

### Audit Trail (Comprehensive)
- âœ… Every PHI access logged
- âœ… Every data export logged
- âœ… Every batch execution logged
- âœ… Every LLM request logged
- âœ… All logs include user identifier
- âœ… 6-year retention (HIPAA requirement)

**Storage:** `logs/audit.log` (JSON) + `audit_log` database table

## For HIPAA Audits

If asked to demonstrate compliance:

### 1. Access Controls

**Q: How do you identify users?**
**A:** SFDC_USERNAME environment variable provides unique user identification. All audit logs include this identifier.

**Show:** Sidebar user badge, audit log entries with user_id

### 2. Encryption

**Q: How is PHI encrypted?**
**A:**
- At rest: SQLCipher with AES-256 encryption
- In transit: HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ encryption
- Database encrypted with key in `.encryption_key` file (0600 permissions)

**Show:** SSL certificate, encrypted database file, security headers

### 3. Audit Logging

**Q: How do you track PHI access?**
**A:** All PHI access is logged with:
- User identifier (SFDC_USERNAME)
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Action performed (read/export/modify)
- Dataset and record count
- Success/failure status

**Show:**
```bash
tail -20 logs/audit.log
```

### 4. Business Associate Agreements

**Q: Do you have BAAs with third parties?**
**A:**
- Salesforce: BAA in place (to be documented)
- Microsoft Copilot: BAA verified
- OpenAI: No BAA - **provider disabled in code**
- LM Studio: N/A (localhost only, no PHI leaves premises)

**Show:** `HIPAA_BAA_STATUS.md`, code that blocks OpenAI

### 5. Physical Security

**Q: How is physical access controlled?**
**A:**
- Application runs on single Windows machine
- Windows OS login provides physical access control
- Application accessible only via localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Network middleware blocks external access attempts

**Show:** App startup logs showing localhost-only binding

---

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- Monitor application for errors
- Check audit logs for anomalies:
  ```bash
  tail -50 logs/audit.log | grep "success\":false"
  ```

### Weekly
- Backup encrypted database:
  ```bash
  copy analysis_batches.db backups\analysis_batches_YYYYMMDD.db
  ```
- Backup encryption key (secure location):
  ```bash
  copy .encryption_key backups\.encryption_key_YYYYMMDD
  ```
- Backup audit logs:
  ```bash
  xcopy logs\*.log backups\logs\ /s /y
  ```

### Monthly
- Review audit logs for compliance
- Verify BAAs are current
- Check SSL certificate expiration (10-year validity)
- Test backup restoration

### Annually
- Review HIPAA compliance documentation
- Update BAA status
- Security assessment/audit
- Staff training (if expanded to multi-user)

## Important Files - DO NOT DELETE

### Critical Security Files
```
.encryption_key          # Database encryption key (BACKUP THIS!)
ssl/localhost.key        # SSL private key (REGENERATE if compromised)
ssl/localhost.crt        # SSL certificate
.env                     # Configuration including SFDC_USERNAME
```

### Critical Data Files
```
analysis_batches.db      # Encrypted database with all data
logs/audit.log*          # Audit logs (6-year retention required)
```

### Backup Strategy

**What to backup:**
1. `.encryption_key` (CRITICAL - can't decrypt database without it)
2. `analysis_batches.db` (encrypted database)
3. `logs/audit.log*` (all audit logs)
4. `.env` (configuration - store securely)

**Where to backup:**
- Encrypted external drive
- Encrypted cloud storage (with appropriate BAA)
- Offline secure location

**Frequency:**
- Daily: Database and logs
- Weekly: Full backup including encryption key
- Monthly: Verify backup can be restored

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

While you're now fully HIPAA compliant, consider these optional enhancements:

### 1. De-identification Layer (Recommended)
**Benefit:** Additional protection before sending PHI to external LLMs
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Priority:** Medium

Implement HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification:
- Hash/remove 18 HIPAA identifiers
- Keep PHI in local database
- Send only de-identified data to Copilot

### 2. Disaster Recovery Plan
**Benefit:** Business continuity
**Effort:** 1 day
**Priority:** Medium

Document procedures for:
- Database corruption recovery
- Encryption key loss recovery
- System failure recovery

### 3. Third-Party Security Audit
**Benefit:** Independent verification
**Effort:** Hire external auditor
**Cost:** $5,000-$15,000
**Priority:** Low (good practice, not required for single-user)

## Troubleshooting

### HTTPS Not Working

**Symptom:** Application starts on HTTP not HTTPS

**Check:**
1. SSL certificates exist: `dir ssl\`
2. USE_HTTPS=true in .env
3. No errors in startup logs

**Fix:**
```bash
python generate_ssl_cert.py
python app.py
```

### User Not Showing

**Symptom:** Sidebar shows yellow "Not configured" badge

**Check:**
1. SFDC_USERNAME in .env file
2. .env file in application directory
3. Application restarted after changing .env

**Fix:**
```env
# Add to .env
SFDC_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
```

### Database Locked

**Symptom:** Error: "database is locked"

**Cause:** Multiple instances running or crash recovery needed

**Fix:**
1. Close all application instances
2. Check task manager for python processes
3. Restart application

### Audit Logs Not Writing

**Symptom:** logs/audit.log not updating

**Check:**
1. logs/ directory exists
2. Write permissions on logs/ directory
3. Disk space available

**Fix:**
```bash
mkdir logs
# Check disk space
```
