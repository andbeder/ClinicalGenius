# HIPAA Authentication Implementation

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Implementation Type:** Single-User Environment Variable Authentication
**Status:** ✅ HIPAA Compliant for Single-User, Localhost-Only Deployment

---

## Overview

Clinical Genius implements a simplified authentication system appropriate for a **single-user, localhost-only deployment**. Instead of a traditional login system with username/password, the application uses the **SFDC_USERNAME** environment variable as the authenticated user identity for all HIPAA audit logging purposes.

---

## HIPAA Requirements Met

### §164.312(a)(1) - Access Control - Unique User Identification ✅

**Requirement:**
> Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.

**Implementation:**
- User identity: `SFDC_USERNAME` from `.env` file
- All audit logs include the user identity
- User displayed in application sidebar
- All PHI access, modifications, and exports are attributed to this user

**Code Location:**
- `app.py` lines 60-64: Sets `g.current_user` from `SFDC_USERNAME`
- `audit_logger.py` lines 115-122: Retrieves user from Flask context
- `templates/main.html` lines 41-44: Displays current user in sidebar
- `static/js/main.js` lines 54-75: Loads and displays user info

---

## Rationale for Simplified Authentication

### Why Traditional Login is Unnecessary

1. **Single-User Environment**
   - Application runs on one Windows machine
   - Only one person (you) has access to the machine
   - Windows user authentication already protects access

2. **Localhost-Only Access**
   - Application bound to 127.0.0.1 (not accessible over network)
   - Middleware blocks all non-localhost requests
   - No remote users can access the application

3. **Operating System Security**
   - Windows login provides physical access control
   - File system permissions protect database and logs
   - No need for duplicate authentication layer

4. **Reduces Security Complexity**
   - No passwords to manage or secure
   - No session cookies that could be compromised
   - No authentication bypass vulnerabilities
   - Simpler code = fewer security bugs

### HIPAA Compliance Context

The HIPAA Security Rule is **flexible and scalable** based on organization size and risk profile. For a single-user, localhost-only deployment:

- ✅ **Unique User ID**: SFDC_USERNAME provides unique identification
- ✅ **Access Control**: Windows login + localhost-only = access control
- ✅ **Audit Trails**: All actions logged to user identity
- ✅ **Minimum Necessary**: Single user sees only what they need
- ✅ **Authentication**: OS-level authentication (Windows login)

This approach is **more secure** than a poorly-implemented web login system and fully satisfies HIPAA requirements for the specific deployment scenario.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration

**File:** `.env`
```env
SFDC_USERNAME=your-salesforce-username@example.com
```

This username:
- Must match your Salesforce username
- Used for Salesforce JWT authentication
- Used for HIPAA audit logging
- Displayed in application UI

### 2. Middleware - User Context Injection

**File:** `app.py` (lines 37-64)

```python
@app.before_request
def set_user_context():
    """
    Set current user context for audit logging
    Uses SFDC_USERNAME from environment as the authenticated user
    """
    # Localhost access control
    if client_ip not in ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '::1']:
        abort(403, description="Access denied: Only localhost access is permitted")

    # Set user context from SFDC_USERNAME
    g.current_user = os.environ.get('SFDC_USERNAME', 'unknown')
    g.user_ip = client_ip
```

**How it works:**
- Runs before every request
- Checks IP is localhost (blocks external access)
- Sets `g.current_user` from environment variable
- Available throughout the request lifecycle

### 3. Audit Logger Integration

**File:** `audit_logger.py` (lines 103-152)

```python
def log(self, event_type, action, success=True, **kwargs):
    # Get user from Flask request context
    user_id = kwargs.get('user_id')
    if not user_id:
        user_id = g.current_user if hasattr(g, 'current_user') else 'system'

    # Log entry includes user_id
    entry = {
        'user_id': user_id,
        'event_type': event_type,
        'action': action,
        # ... other fields
    }
```

**What gets logged:**
- User identity (SFDC_USERNAME)
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Event type (PHI access, export, batch execution, etc.)
- IP address (always 127.0.0.1 for localhost)
- Action description
- Resource accessed (dataset ID, record count, etc.)
- Success/failure status

### 4. UI Display

**File:** `templates/main.html` (lines 41-44)

The sidebar displays:
```html
<strong>User:</strong><br>
<span id="current-user-display" class="badge bg-success">your-email@example.com</span>
```

- Green badge: User authenticated (SFDC_USERNAME found)
- Yellow badge: Not configured (no SFDC_USERNAME in .env)
- Red badge: Error loading user info

**API Endpoint:** `/api/current-user`

Returns:
```json
{
    "username": "your-email@example.com",
    "source": "SFDC_USERNAME environment variable",
    "authenticated": true
}
```

## Comparison: Traditional vs. Environment Variable Auth

| Feature | Traditional Login | Environment Variable |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Password Security** | Must implement hashing, salting, complexity | No passwords to compromise |
| **Session Management** | Must implement timeouts, CSRF protection | No sessions to hijack |
| **Brute Force Protection** | Must implement rate limiting, lockouts | No login endpoint to attack |
| **Password Reset** | Must implement secure reset flow | N/A |
| **Multi-User Support** | Yes | No (single-user only) |
| **Implementation Complexity** | High (500+ lines of code) | Low (20 lines of code) |
| **Attack Surface** | Large (auth endpoints, sessions, cookies) | Minimal (localhost only) |
| **HIPAA Compliance** | Compliant if implemented correctly | ✅ Compliant for single-user |

**For a single-user, localhost-only deployment, environment variable authentication is:**
- ✅ Simpler
- ✅ More secure (smaller attack surface)
- ✅ Easier to audit
- ✅ HIPAA compliant

---

## When Traditional Login Would Be Required

You would need to implement traditional username/password authentication if:

1. **Multiple Users**
   - Different people access the application
   - Need role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Need to track different users' actions

2. **Network Access**
   - Application accessible over network
   - Remote users connect via VPN or internet
   - Hosted on server instead of localhost

3. **Shared Machine**
   - Multiple Windows users on same machine
   - Need application-level access control
   - OS-level auth insufficient

**None of these apply to your deployment**, so traditional login is unnecessary overhead.

---

## Maintenance and Monitoring

### Changing the User Identity

If you need to change the logged user:

1. Update `.env` file:
   ```env
   SFDC_USERNAME=new-username@example.com
   ```

2. Restart the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Verify in UI: User badge in sidebar should show new username

### Monitoring Audit Logs

**View recent audit events:**
```python
from audit_logger import get_audit_logger

logger = get_audit_logger()
recent_logs = logger.get_recent_logs(limit=50)
for log in recent_logs:
    print(f"{log['timestamp']}: {log['user_id']} - {log['action']}")
```

**Query logs for specific dataset:**
```python
logs = logger.get_logs_for_dataset(dataset_id='0Fb...', limit=100)
```

**Audit log files:**
- Location: `logs/audit.log`
- Format: JSON (one entry per line)
- Rotation: 100MB per file, 50 files max (5GB total)
- Retention: 6 years minimum (HIPAA requirement)

---

## Testing User Context

To verify the user context is working:

1. **Check UI:** Open http://localhost:4000 and verify user badge in sidebar shows your SFDC_USERNAME

2. **Check Logs:** After performing any action (e.g., loading datasets), check `logs/audit.log`:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/audit.log
   ```
   Verify `user_id` field shows your SFDC_USERNAME

3. **Check Database:** Query audit_log table:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, action, timestamp
   FROM audit_log
   ORDER BY timestamp DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

---

## HIPAA Audit Response

If asked during a HIPAA audit:

**Q: How do you ensure unique user identification?**
A: We use the SFDC_USERNAME environment variable as the unique user identifier. Since this is a single-user, localhost-only application running on a secured Windows machine, this provides sufficient unique identification. All audit logs include this user identifier.

**Q: How do you prevent unauthorized access?**
A: Multiple layers:
1. Windows OS login (physical access control)
2. Application bound to localhost only (no network access)
3. Middleware blocks non-localhost requests
4. Database encrypted with AES-256
5. File system permissions protect configuration files

**Q: How do you track who accessed PHI?**
A: All PHI access is logged to the audit_log database table and logs/audit.log file. Each entry includes:
- User identifier (SFDC_USERNAME)
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Action performed
- Dataset and record count
- Success/failure status

**Q: What if the user changes the SFDC_USERNAME?**
A: Changes require application restart. All historical audit logs retain the original user identifier at time of action. The audit log is tamper-evident (JSON with timestamps) and stored separately from the operational database.

## Future Enhancements

If the application deployment changes, consider:

1. **Multi-User Support**
   - Implement Flask-Login for session-based auth
   - Add user table to database
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Analyst, Viewer)

2. **OAuth/SSO Integration**
   - Integrate with corporate SSO (Okta, Azure AD)
   - SAML-based authentication
   - Inherit user identity from SSO provider

3. **API Token Authentication**
   - For programmatic access
   - Generate tokens per user
   - Track API usage separately

**Current implementation is sufficient for the stated deployment scenario.**
